# Summary

This is my code for a timed multiple choice quiz with a scores stored in a local storage.
I did borrow code from the references and help from class notes. When selecting answers the app should alert you if it was correct or incorrect and at the end you can submit your initial to track your score. Time should deplete for every wrong answer.
